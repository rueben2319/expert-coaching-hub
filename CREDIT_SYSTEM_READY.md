FROM credit_wallets cw
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = cw.user_id
ORDER BY cw.balance DESC;

-- Recent transactions
SELECT ct.*, u.email
FROM credit_transactions ct
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = ct.user_id
ORDER BY ct.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Pending withdrawals

## **⚠️ Important Notes**

### **PayChangu Test Mode**
- Use test credentials for development
- Test cards won't charge real money
- Webhooks work in test mode

### **Webhook Reliability**
- PayChangu retries failed webhooks
- Idempotency prevents double-processing
- Check logs if credits don't appear

### **Admin Withdrawal Processing**
- Currently manual (by design)
- Admin dashboard coming soon
- Update status in database directly for now:
```sql
UPDATE withdrawal_requests
SET status = 'completed',
    processed_at = NOW(),
    processed_by = 'admin_user_id',
    transaction_ref = 'PAYMENT_REF_123'
WHERE id = 'withdrawal_request_id';
```
