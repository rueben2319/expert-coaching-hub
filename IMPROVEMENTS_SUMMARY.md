## How to Test

### 1. Rate Limiting
```bash
# Make 6 withdrawal requests in < 1 hour
# The 6th should fail with: "Rate limit exceeded"
```

### 2. Daily Limits
```bash
# Try to withdraw 60,000 credits in one day
# Should fail after 50,000 with: "Daily limit exceeded"
```

### 3. Credit Aging
```bash
# Create new user, buy credits, try immediate withdrawal
# Should fail with: "Credits must age 3 days"
```

### 4. Fraud Detection
```bash
# New account + large withdrawal
# Should flag with high score
# Score ‚â• 75 blocks transaction
```

---

## Quick Start

### Adjust Limits
Edit constants in `supabase/functions/immediate-withdrawal/index.ts`:
```typescript
const MAX_WITHDRAWAL = 100000;
const MIN_WITHDRAWAL = 10;
const DAILY_LIMIT = 50000;
const CREDIT_AGING_DAYS = 3;
```

### Enable Slack Alerts
```bash
# Set environment variable
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/...
```

### View Flagged Withdrawals
```sql
SELECT * FROM withdrawal_requests
WHERE fraud_score >= 50
ORDER BY fraud_score DESC;
```
