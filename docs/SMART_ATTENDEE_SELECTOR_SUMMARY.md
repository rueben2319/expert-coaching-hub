2. **Course Selected**: Filters to only show enrolled clients
3. **Real-time Update**: Client list updates when course changes

### Attendee Selection
1. **Visual Selection**: Click clients from dropdown with avatars
2. **Search Functionality**: Type to find specific clients

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```typescript
// 1. Course selection triggers client list update
courseId â†’ useCoachClients(courseId) â†’ filtered client list

// 2. Client selection updates attendee state
client selection â†’ selectedEmails[] â†’ form validation

// 3. Manual emails merge with selected clients
manual emails + selected clients â†’ final attendee list
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Course-specific clients
SELECT profiles.* FROM course_enrollments 
JOIN profiles ON course_enrollments.user_id = profiles.id
WHERE course_id = ? AND courses.user_id = coach_id

-- All coach clients
SELECT DISTINCT profiles.* FROM course_enrollments
JOIN courses ON course_enrollments.course_id = courses.id  
JOIN profiles ON course_enrollments.user_id = profiles.id
WHERE courses.user_id = coach_id
```

### Component Architecture
```
CreateSession
â”œâ”€â”€ CourseSelector (existing)
â”œâ”€â”€ AttendeeSelector (new)

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Selected badges display
