# 🔧 Credit System Migration Fix Guide

## **🎯 Quick Fix: 2 Critical Issues**

Two migration files have been created to fix critical issues found in the audit.

---

## **📁 Files Created**

### **1. Wallet Trigger Migration**
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20241022_create_credit_wallet_trigger.sql`

**Purpose**: Automatically creates a credit wallet when a new user signs up.

**What it does**:
- Creates a trigger on `auth.users` table
- Calls `initialize_credit_wallet()` function on INSERT
- Ensures every new user gets a wallet

---

### **2. Credit Packages Seed Data**
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20241022_seed_credit_packages.sql`

**Purpose**: Creates the 5 default credit packages.

**Packages**:
1. **Starter** - 100 credits for MWK 10,000
2. **Basic** - 260 credits (250 + 10 bonus) for MWK 24,000
3. **Popular** - 530 credits (500 + 30 bonus) for MWK 45,000
4. **Premium** - 1,100 credits (1,000 + 100 bonus) for MWK 85,000
5. **Ultimate** - 2,800 credits (2,500 + 300 bonus) for MWK 200,000

---

## **🚀 Deployment Steps**

### **Option 1: Using Supabase CLI** (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:\Users\Rue\Documents\Paid Projects\expert-coaching-hub"

# Apply migrations
supabase db push

# Or apply specific migrations
supabase migration up
```

### **Option 2: Using Supabase Dashboard**

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy and paste the content of each migration file
5. Run them in order:
   - First: `20241022_create_credit_wallet_trigger.sql`
   - Second: `20241022_seed_credit_packages.sql`

### **Option 3: Using psql**

```bash
# Connect to your database
psql "postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# Run migrations
\i supabase/migrations/20241022_create_credit_wallet_trigger.sql
\i supabase/migrations/20241022_seed_credit_packages.sql
```

## **✅ Verification Steps**

### **1. Verify Trigger Exists**
```sql
-- Check if trigger was created
SELECT 
  trigger_name, 
  event_manipulation, 
  event_object_table,
  action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
```

**Expected Result**: 1 row showing the trigger on `auth.users`

---

### **2. Verify Credit Packages Exist**
```sql
-- Check if packages were seeded
SELECT 
  name, 
  credits, 
  bonus_credits, 
  price_mwk, 
  is_active,
  sort_order
FROM public.credit_packages
ORDER BY sort_order;
```

**Expected Result**: 5 rows (Starter, Basic, Popular, Premium, Ultimate)

---

### **3. Test Wallet Auto-Creation**
```sql
-- Create a test user (this will trigger wallet creation)
-- Note: Use Supabase Auth to create a real user, or test via signup

-- Then check if wallet was created
SELECT 
  u.email,
  cw.balance,
  cw.total_earned,
  cw.total_spent
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN public.credit_wallets cw ON cw.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Result**: All users should have a wallet (no NULL values)

---

## **🐛 Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Trigger creation fails**

**Error**: `permission denied for table auth.users`

**Solution**: The migration needs to be run with elevated privileges. Use Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor or ensure your database user has proper permissions.

---

### **Issue: Packages already exist**

**Error**: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint`

**Solution**: The migration uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so this shouldn't happen. If it does, packages already exist and you're good to go!

---

### **Issue: Existing users don't have wallets**

**Problem**: Users created before the trigger won't have wallets.

**Solution**: Run this one-time fix:
```sql
-- Create wallets for existing users who don't have one
INSERT INTO public.credit_wallets (user_id, balance)
SELECT 
  u.id,
  0.00
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN public.credit_wallets cw ON cw.user_id = u.id
WHERE cw.id IS NULL
ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING;
```

## **🎯 Impact**

### **Wallet Trigger**
- **Users Affected**: All new users
- **Benefit**: Automatic wallet creation
- **Risk**: None (safe operation)
- **Rollback**: Drop trigger if needed

### **Credit Packages**
- **Users Affected**: All users
- **Benefit**: Can purchase credits
- **Risk**: None (just data)
- **Rollback**: Delete packages if needed

---

## **📝 Post-Deployment Checklist**

After running the migrations:

- [ ] Verify trigger exists (SQL query above)
- [ ] Verify packages exist (SQL query above)
- [ ] Create a test user account
- [ ] Confirm test user has a wallet
- [ ] Navigate to `/client/credits` page
- [ ] Confirm 5 packages are displayed
- [ ] Test credit purchase flow (optional)
- [ ] Check Edge Function logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

---

## **🔄 Rollback Plan**

If you need to undo these changes:

### **Remove Trigger**
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
```

### **Remove Packages**
```sql
DELETE FROM public.credit_packages 
WHERE name IN ('Starter', 'Basic', 'Popular', 'Premium', 'Ultimate');
```

**Note**: Rollback is rarely needed as these are safe, additive changes.
