## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. ✅ **Push pending migrations** to seed credit packages
   ```bash
   supabase db push --password "your-password"
   ```

2. ⏳ **Set environment secrets** for production
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set PAYCHANGU_SECRET_KEY=xxx
   supabase secrets set PAYCHANGU_WEBHOOK_SECRET=xxx
   ```

3. ⏳ **Configure PayChangu webhook** 
   - URL: `https://vbrxgaxjmpwusbbbzzgl.supabase.co/functions/v1/credits-webhook`
   - Copy webhook secret to environment

### Testing
1. ⏳ Test credit purchase flow
2. ⏳ Test course enrollment with credits
3. ⏳ Test withdrawal request flow
4. ⏳ Verify webhook processing

### Production Hardening
1. ⏳ Restrict CORS to production domain
2. ⏳ Add rate limiting
3. ⏳ Set up monitoring/alerts
4. ⏳ Create admin dashboard for withdrawals
