# Quick Deployment Guide - Lesson Progress Fixes

**Status**: ✅ Ready to Deploy  
**Risk**: ⚠️ Low (backward compatible)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration (5 min)

**Option A - Supabase CLI** (recommended):
```bash
cd /workspace
supabase db push
```

**Option B - Supabase Dashboard**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open file: `supabase/migrations/20251024000001_add_lesson_completion_logging.sql`
3. Copy entire contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"
6. Verify: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lesson_completion_attempts;` should return 0

---

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend (10 min)

**If using Git deployment**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement lesson progress tracking fixes

- Add video watch time persistence and fallback tracking
- Add quiz attempt history tracking
- Add text reading time requirements
- Fix race condition in lesson auto-completion
- Add lesson completion logging for debugging
- Improve course progress calculation (weighted by lessons)
- Add visibility API for accurate time tracking
- Handle short text content edge case

All changes are backward compatible."

git push origin main
```

**If using manual deployment**:
1. Build: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
2. Deploy build artifacts to hosting platform
3. Verify deployment success

### Step 3: Smoke Test (15 min)

#### Test Checklist:

**Video Content**:
- [ ] Start watching a video
- [ ] Refresh page mid-watch
- [ ] Verify watch time restored
- [ ] Complete video to 90%
- [ ] Verify marked complete

**Quiz Content**:
- [ ] Take a quiz
- [ ] Fail intentionally
- [ ] Retry and pass
- [ ] Check UI shows "Attempts: 2, Best: 100%"

**Text Content**:
- [ ] Open text content
- [ ] Try to complete immediately (should require time)
- [ ] Wait for countdown
- [ ] Mark complete when button appears

**Lesson Completion**:
- [ ] Complete all required content in a lesson
- [ ] Verify lesson auto-marks complete
- [ ] Verify only ONE toast notification appears
- [ ] Verify course progress updates

**Database Verification**:
```sql
-- Check new table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lesson_completion_attempts;

-- Check function updated (should show logging code)
SELECT pg_get_functiondef('mark_lesson_complete'::regproc);

-- Check data being saved
SELECT * FROM content_interactions 
WHERE interaction_data IS NOT NULL 
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### User-Facing Changes:
1. ✅ Video progress never lost on reload
2. ✅ Text content requires minimum reading time (shows countdown)
3. ✅ Quiz shows attempt count and best score
4. ✅ More accurate course progress percentages
5. ✅ Interactive content time persists across sessions

### Behind-the-Scenes:
1. ✅ Fallback video tracking (reliable even if platform APIs fail)
2. ✅ Periodic progress saving (every 10 seconds)
3. ✅ Visibility API (only tracks when tab is active)
4. ✅ Lesson completion logging (debug "won't complete" issues)
5. ✅ Race condition fix (no duplicate notifications)

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### After deployment, monitor:

**Application Logs**:
```bash
# Look for these log messages
"Restored watch time: X"
"Saved interaction progress: X"
"Fallback tracking: +30s"
"Marking lesson complete: LESSON_ID"
```

**Database Queries**:
```sql
-- Monitor lesson completion attempts (should see entries)
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', attempted_at) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as attempts,
  SUM(CASE WHEN success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successes,
  SUM(CASE WHEN NOT success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failures
FROM lesson_completion_attempts
WHERE attempted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour DESC;

-- Check content interactions have new metadata
SELECT 
  content_id,
  is_completed,
  interaction_data->>'watch_time' as watch_time,
  interaction_data->>'attempt_count' as attempts,
  interaction_data->>'time_spent' as time_spent
FROM content_interactions
WHERE updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
LIMIT 10;
```

**User Feedback**:
- Watch for complaints about "lesson won't complete"
- Monitor support tickets for progress-related issues
- Track completion rates (should improve)

---

## 🔥 Rollback Plan (if needed)

### Quick Rollback (5 min):
```bash
# Revert code changes
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Rebuild and deploy
npm run build
# Deploy...
```

**Note**: Database migration can stay (it's safe and useful for debugging). But if needed:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS lesson_completion_attempts CASCADE;
-- Then re-create original mark_lesson_complete function from backup
```

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find table lesson_completion_attempts"
**Solution**: Migration not applied. Run Step 1 again.

### Issue: Videos still losing progress
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `content_interactions` table has `interaction_data` column
3. Check user's browser allows local storage

### Issue: Lesson won't auto-complete
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Debug with this query
SELECT 
  lca.attempted_at,
  lca.success,
  lca.required_count,
  lca.completed_count,
  lca.details
FROM lesson_completion_attempts lca
WHERE lca.lesson_id = 'PROBLEM_LESSON_ID'
  AND lca.user_id = 'PROBLEM_USER_ID'
ORDER BY lca.attempted_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
This shows exactly why completion failed (required vs completed counts).

### Issue: Duplicate toast notifications still appearing
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and reload. The debouncing should prevent this.

## 📈 Success Metrics

After 24 hours, check:

1. **Lesson Completion Rate**: Should increase
2. **Support Tickets**: "Lesson won't complete" tickets should decrease
3. **Error Logs**: Should see no new errors
4. **User Engagement**: Time on content should be more accurate
5. **Database**: `lesson_completion_attempts` should have entries

---

## 📞 Support

### If issues arise:

1. **Check Documentation**:
   - `LESSON_PROGRESS_DEEP_DIVE.md` - Analysis
   - `LESSON_PROGRESS_FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Detailed implementation
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary

2. **Debug Queries**:
   See "Monitoring" section above

3. **Browser Console**:
   Look for these messages:
   - "Restored watch time: X"
   - "Saved interaction progress"
   - "Fallback tracking: +30s"
   - "Tab hidden - pausing tracking"

4. **Rollback**: See "Rollback Plan" above
