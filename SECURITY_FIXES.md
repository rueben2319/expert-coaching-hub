# Security Vulnerabilities and Bugs Fixed

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Configuration Security (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Disabled type safety checks allowing implicit `any` types and null access
**Fix**: Enabled strict TypeScript configuration with proper type checking
**Impact**: Prevents runtime errors and type-related security vulnerabilities

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Supabase credentials hardcoded in client-side code
**Fix**: Moved to environment variables with fallbacks
**Impact**: Better credential management and environment separation

### 3. Authentication Race Condition (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Race conditions in auth state management causing inconsistent states
**Fix**: Added proper async handling and cleanup flags
**Impact**: Prevents authentication bypass and state corruption

### 4. Authorization Bypass (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Protected routes could allow access for users without roles
**Fix**: Added proper null checks for user roles
**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized access to protected resources

### 5. Input Validation Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Insufficient input validation in Supabase functions
**Fix**: Added comprehensive input sanitization and validation
**Impact**: Prevents injection attacks and data corruption

### 6. CORS Security Issue (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Overly permissive CORS allowing any origin
**Fix**: Restricted CORS to specific allowed origins
**Impact**: Prevents cross-origin attacks

## High Priority Issues Fixed

### 7. Memory Leak in React Components (HIGH)
**Issue**: Missing dependencies in useEffect causing memory leaks
**Fix**: Added proper dependency tracking and change detection
**Impact**: Improves performance and prevents memory issues

### 8. Information Disclosure (HIGH)
**Issue**: Error messages exposing sensitive internal information
**Fix**: Sanitized error messages for client consumption
**Impact**: Prevents information leakage to attackers

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed

### 9. XSS Prevention (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: User input not sanitized before API calls
**Fix**: Added basic input sanitization for HTML/script content
**Impact**: Prevents cross-site scripting attacks

### 10. Performance Optimization (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: Unnecessary re-renders in React hooks
**Fix**: Added memoization to prevent excessive re-renders
**Impact**: Improves application performance

## Environment Configuration

Created `.env.example` with proper environment variable structure for:
- Supabase configuration
- Google OAuth credentials
- Payment gateway settings
- CORS and security settings

## Recommendations for Further Security

1. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers
2. **Add rate limiting** to API endpoints
3. **Implement proper logging and monitoring**
4. **Regular security audits** of dependencies
5. **Add input validation middleware** for all API routes
6. **Implement proper session management**
7. **Add CSRF protection** for state-changing operations
8. **Regular penetration testing**

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test authentication flows with various edge cases
2. Verify input validation with malicious payloads
3. Test CORS configuration with different origins
4. Validate error handling doesn't leak information
5. Performance testing for memory leaks
6. Security testing for XSS and injection vulnerabilities
