## What is the Credit System?

A **virtual currency platform** where users buy credits with real money, spend credits on courses, and coaches can cash out their earnings.

```
Real Money (MWK) → Credits → Course Access → Coach Earnings → Real Money (MWK)
```

---

## How It Works (3-Step Flow)

### 1. **Buy Credits**
- Client chooses a package (100 to 2,500 credits)
- Pays via PayChangu (mobile money, cards)
- Credits instantly added to wallet

### 2. **Spend Credits**
- Client enrolls in premium course
- Credits transferred from client to coach
- Instant course access granted

### 3. **Cash Out**
- Coach requests withdrawal
- Credits converted to MWK (1 credit = 100 MWK)
- Money sent to mobile wallet instantly

## What Needs Improvement ⚠️

### 🔴 High Priority

**1. No Rate Limiting**
- **Issue:** Unlimited withdrawal requests
- **Risk:** API abuse, spam
- **Fix:** Limit to 5 withdrawals per hour

**2. No Fraud Detection**
- **Issue:** No pattern analysis
- **Risk:** Stolen cards → buy → withdraw → cash out
- **Fix:** Implement fraud scoring system

**3. No Transaction Limits**
- **Issue:** Can withdraw unlimited amount at once
- **Risk:** Account compromise → drain all funds
- **Fix:** Set max 10,000 credits per transaction

### 🟡 Medium Priority

**4. No 2FA for Withdrawals**
- **Issue:** Password-only authentication
- **Risk:** Phishing → account takeover
- **Fix:** Require email/SMS confirmation

**5. No Monitoring**
- **Issue:** No real-time alerts
- **Risk:** Issues go unnoticed
- **Fix:** Add Sentry + custom alerts

**6. No Withdrawal Cooldown**
- **Issue:** Can withdraw immediately after earning
- **Risk:** Money laundering potential
- **Fix:** Require 3-day credit aging

---

## Production Readiness

### Current Status: 🟢 **READY FOR MVP**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Core functionality works correctly
- ✅ Money handling is secure
- ✅ Good error handling
- ✅ Complete audit trail

**Caveats:**
- ⚠️ Missing fraud prevention
- ⚠️ No operational monitoring
- ⚠️ Needs testing before scale

### Recommendation

**Safe to launch** for:
- Small user base (< 1,000 users)
- Controlled beta testing
- MVP validation

**Before scaling**, implement:
1. Rate limiting (1 day)
2. Transaction limits (1 day)
3. Monitoring & alerts (3 days)
4. Fraud detection (1 week)
5. 2FA for withdrawals (1 week)
6. Withdrawal cooldown (1 week)

- Can withdraw anytime (instant)
- No platform fee on earnings

**Revenue Model:**
- Margin on credit purchases (credit value vs MWK price)
- No withdrawal fees charged to users

---

## Compliance & Legal

### Data Stored
- User balances
- Transaction history
- Payment details (encrypted by PayChangu)
