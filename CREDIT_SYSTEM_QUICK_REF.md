## üîß Common Tasks

### Get User's Balance
```typescript
import { useCredits } from "@/hooks/useCredits";

const { balance, totalEarned, totalSpent } = useCredits();
```

### Purchase Credits
```typescript
const { purchaseCredits } = useCredits();

purchaseCredits.mutate(packageId);
// User is redirected to PayChangu checkout
```

### Enroll in Course with Credits
```typescript
const { enrollWithCredits } = useCredits();

enrollWithCredits.mutate(courseId);
// Credits transferred, enrollment created
```

### Request Withdrawal
```typescript
const { requestWithdrawal } = useCredits();

requestWithdrawal.mutate({
  credits_amount: 500,
  payment_method: "mobile_money",
  payment_details: { mobile: "+265999123456" },
  notes: "Optional note",
});
```

### Get Transaction History
```typescript
const { transactions, transactionsLoading } = useCredits();

transactions?.map(tx => ({
  type: tx.transaction_type,
  amount: tx.amount,
  date: tx.created_at,
}));
```

---

## üîê Database Functions

### `transfer_credits()`

**Purpose:** Atomically transfer credits between users

```sql
SELECT transfer_credits(
  from_user_id := '<client_id>',
  to_user_id := '<coach_id>',
  amount := 50.00,
  transaction_type := 'course_payment',
  reference_type := 'course_enrollment',
  reference_id := '<enrollment_id>',
  description := 'Enrolled in React Course',
  metadata := '{"course_id": "..."}'::jsonb
);
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "sender_transaction_id": "uuid",
  "receiver_transaction_id": "uuid"
}
```

**Errors:**
- `'Insufficient balance'`
- `'Sender wallet not found'`
- `'Amount must be positive'`

## üß™ Testing Locally

### 1. Setup Environment Variables
```bash
# .env.local
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 2. Test Credit Purchase (without real payment)
```typescript
// Manually insert credits for testing
const { error } = await supabase
  .from("credit_transactions")
  .insert({
    user_id: userId,
    transaction_type: "purchase",
    amount: 500,
    balance_before: 0,
    balance_after: 500,
    description: "Test purchase",
  });

await supabase
  .from("credit_wallets")
  .update({ balance: 500 })
  .eq("user_id", userId);
```

### 3. Test Enrollment
```typescript
// Ensure course has price_credits set
await supabase
  .from("courses")
  .update({ price_credits: 50 })
  .eq("id", courseId);

// Then test enrollment flow
const { enrollWithCredits } = useCredits();
await enrollWithCredits.mutateAsync(courseId);
```

## üêõ Common Issues

### "Insufficient balance"
**Cause:** User doesn't have enough credits  
**Fix:** Check wallet balance before attempting transfer

### "Wallet not found"
**Cause:** User doesn't have a wallet yet  
**Fix:** Wallets are auto-created on signup. If missing:
```sql
INSERT INTO credit_wallets (user_id, balance)
VALUES ('<user_id>', 0);
```

### "Package not found"
**Cause:** Package is inactive or deleted  
**Fix:** Check `is_active = true` on credit_packages

### "Invalid mobile number"
**Cause:** Wrong format for Malawi numbers  
**Fix:** Must be 9 digits starting with 99, 88, 77, or 76

---

## üîç Debugging

### Check Wallet Balance
```sql
SELECT * FROM credit_wallets
WHERE user_id = '<user_id>';
```

### View Transaction History
```sql
SELECT * FROM credit_transactions
WHERE user_id = '<user_id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Pending Transactions
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE user_id = '<user_id>'
  AND status = 'pending'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### View Withdrawal Requests
```sql
SELECT * FROM withdrawal_requests
WHERE coach_id = '<coach_id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Credit Package Prices
```sql
-- View current packages
SELECT name, credits, bonus_credits, price_mwk, is_active
FROM credit_packages
ORDER BY sort_order;

-- Add new package
INSERT INTO credit_packages (
  name, description, credits, bonus_credits, 
  price_mwk, is_active, sort_order
) VALUES (
  'Enterprise',
  'For organizations',
  10000,
  1000,
  900000,
  true,
  6
);

-- Deactivate package
UPDATE credit_packages
SET is_active = false
WHERE name = 'Starter';
```

### Conversion Rate
```typescript
// Defined in: src/pages/coach/Withdrawals.tsx
const CONVERSION_RATE = 100; // 1 credit = 100 MWK

// To change, update this constant
```

### Withdrawal Limits
```typescript
// Defined in: supabase/functions/immediate-withdrawal/index.ts
const MAX_WITHDRAWAL = 100000;
const MIN_WITHDRAWAL = 10;

// To change, update these constants
```

## üé® UI Components

### Display Credit Balance
```tsx
import { CreditWallet } from "@/components/CreditWallet";

<CreditWallet 
  showActions={true}  // Show Buy/Withdraw buttons
  compact={false}     // Full view with stats
/>
```

### Display Transactions
```tsx
import { CreditTransactions } from "@/components/CreditTransactions";

<CreditTransactions />
```

### Manual Credit Display
```tsx
const { balance } = useCredits();

<div>
  <span>{balance.toFixed(2)} Credits</span>
</div>
```

## üö® Error Handling

### Frontend
```typescript
const { purchaseCredits } = useCredits();

purchaseCredits.mutate(packageId, {
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
    toast.error(error.message);
  },
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    console.log("Redirecting to:", data.checkout_url);
  },
});
```

### Edge Function
```typescript
try {
  // ... operation
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error);
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }),
    { 
      status: 400,
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
    }
  );
}
```
